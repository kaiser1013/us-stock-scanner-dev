- Added Ruff lint validation.
- Added MyPy type checking.
- Added pytest coverage reporting.
- Added minimum 30% coverage gate.
- Added pyproject.toml development configuration.

### Changed

- Introduced an initial 30% coverage gate.
- Updated scanner version to v2.5.1.
- Standardized automated quality validation for every pull request.

### Preserved

- Preserved all v2.5.0 Relative Strength functionality.
- Preserved Volume Engine behaviour.

## v2.5.0 Multi-Timeframe Relative Strength

### Added

- Added benchmark returns for 21, 63, 126 and 252 sessions.
- Added stock-versus-benchmark Relative Strength fields:
  - RS21
  - RS63
  - RS126
  - RS252
- Added `RSComposite` using 15% RS21, 50% RS63, 25% RS126 and 10% RS252.
- Added the five v2.5 RS fields to candidate results, console output, Excel and email.
- Added `Non-negative RSComposite` to Market Breadth.

- Added `UPGRADE_PLAN_V3.md` with the incremental roadmap to v3.0.

### Changed

- Updated scanner version, email subject and Excel filename to v2.5.0.
- Increased default price-history download from one year to two years.
- Increased minimum indicator history to 253 observations for RS252.
- Expanded market context with `spy_returns`, while preserving the existing `spy_return` 63-session key.
- Updated module documentation to distinguish new research factors from unchanged production logic.

### Preserved

- Preserved all v2.4.1 structured diagnostic outcomes.
- Preserved the five-sheet diagnostic workbook.
- Preserved first-rejection and all-failed-condition reporting.
- Preserved completed-session Volume Engine behaviour and 16:15 New York cutoff.

- Compare v2.5.0 against v2.4.1 using the same market snapshot before setting v2.5.0 as the production baseline.

- Makes `No stocks passed the technical filters` an auditable scanner result.
