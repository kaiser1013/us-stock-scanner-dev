# US Stock Scanner v2.9.0

## Point-in-Time Signal Replay

v2.9.0 introduces the Point-in-Time Signal Replay Engine.

The replay engine generates historical signals using only information available on or before each signal date.

Its primary purpose is to eliminate look-ahead bias before portfolio simulation and walk-forward validation.

### Production Pipeline

```

### Components

- HistoricalSignal
- point_in_time_history()
- generate_signal()
- replay_symbol()
- replay_universe()

### Validation

- Ruff PASS
- MyPy PASS
- 215 Tests PASS
- Coverage 93.45%

### Validated Capabilities

- Point-in-time history selection
- Historical signal generation
- Benchmark replay
- Production filter integration
- Production score integration
- Production risk integration
- Market-regime replay
- Deterministic replay
- Future-row isolation

### Preserved Behaviour

The replay engine does not change:

- Production filters
- Score Engine
- TradePlan logic
- Candidate ranking
- Relative Strength
- Market Regime
- Breakout diagnostics

## Backtest Metrics Foundation

The initial performance-analytics layer supports:

- Win rate
- Average gain
- Average loss
- Profit factor
- Expectancy
- Total return
- CAGR
- Sharpe ratio
- Sortino ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Benchmark return
- Alpha

### Backtest Data Classes

`Trade`

Represents a completed trade with:

- Entry date
- Exit date
- Symbol
- Entry price
- Exit price
- Return percentage

`BacktestResult`

Represents a consolidated backtest result with:

- Trades
- Equity curve
- Performance metrics

### Backtest Functions

`calculate_trade_return`

Calculates the percentage return between an entry price and an exit price.

`calculate_max_drawdown`

Calculates the largest percentage decline from a running equity peak.

`calculate_cagr`

Calculates compound annual growth using a 252-session trading-year assumption.

`calculate_sharpe_ratio`

Calculates an annualised Sharpe ratio from periodic returns.

`calculate_sortino_ratio`

Calculates an annualised Sortino ratio using negative returns as downside observations.

`calculate_profit_factor`

Calculates gross gains divided by absolute gross losses.

`calculate_expectancy`

Calculates expected return per trade from win rate, average gain and average loss.

`build_metrics`

Builds the standard backtest metrics dictionary from an equity curve, trade returns and an optional benchmark return.

## Backtest Metrics Foundation (v2.8.0)

This functionality was introduced in v2.8.0
and remains available in v 2.9.0.

## Backtest Tests

`tests/test_backtest.py` validates:

- Positive trade returns
- Negative trade returns
- Floating-point comparisons using `pytest.approx`
- Maximum drawdown
- Profit factor
- Expectancy
- Required metrics
- Alpha

## Continuous Integration

Every push and pull request automatically executes the configured quality checks:

- Ruff lint validation
- MyPy type checking
- Pytest unit tests
- Scanner-package coverage validation

Quality gates:

- Lint must pass
- Type checking must pass
- All tests must pass
- Configured coverage validation must pass
- Existing production behaviour must remain stable

## Versioning Policy

The project uses sequential numeric versions.

Release-candidate suffixes such as `rc1` and `rc2` are not used.

Current working progression:

- v2.8.0 Backtest Metrics Foundation
- v2.9.0 Point-in-Time Signal Replay
- v2.10.0 Portfolio Simulation and Trade Log
- v2.11.0 Benchmark and Risk Analytics
- v2.12.0 Factor Validation
- v3.0.0 Integrated Walk-Forward Validation

Intermediate release names and scope may be adjusted when implementation requirements change.

## Preserved Production Behaviour

v2.8.0 preserves:

- Structured scanner outcomes
- Production filters and filter order
- Score Engine behaviour
- TradePlan logic
- Candidate ranking
- Completed-session Volume Engine
- Multi-timeframe Relative Strength
- Three-state Market Regime Engine
- Breakout diagnostics
- ATR risk management
- Position sizing
- Five-sheet Excel reporting
- Diagnostic email reporting
- Bear-market alert behaviour

## Candidate Ranking

The production ranking order remains:

1. TradePlan
2. Score
3. RiskReward

The Backtest Metrics Foundation does not change candidate ranking.

## Production Filters

The production filter rules remain:

- Price at least $20
- Average volume at least 1,000,000 shares
- Price above MA20
- MA20 above MA50
- RSI between 40 and 80
- Completed-session VolumeRatio at least 0.8
- MACD not materially below signal
- 63-session RelativeStrength at least -5

## Multi-Timeframe Relative Strength

The scanner calculates:

```text
RS21  = Stock 21-session return  - benchmark 21-session return
RS63  = Stock 63-session return  - benchmark 63-session return
RS126 = Stock 126-session return - benchmark 126-session return
RS252 = Stock 252-session return - benchmark 252-session return
```

`RelativeStrength` remains an alias of `RS63`, preserving existing filter and score behaviour.

### RSComposite

```text
RSComposite = 0.15 * RS21
            + 0.50 * RS63
            + 0.25 * RS126
            + 0.10 * RS252
```

RSComposite is included in console, Excel, email and market-breadth diagnostics.

It remains observational and does not change production filters, score, TradePlan or ranking.

### Data History Requirement

The default price-history download is two years.

At least 253 observations are required to calculate a complete 252-session return.

Stocks without sufficient history use the existing `Indicator Failure` outcome with the reason:

```text
Indicators unavailable or insufficient history
```

## Three-State Market Regime Engine

The scanner classifies the market as:

- BULL
- NEUTRAL
- BEAR

RegimeScore values:

- BULL = 15
- NEUTRAL = 7
- BEAR = 0

`MarketScore` remains a backwards-compatible alias of `RegimeScore`.

Bear protection exits the scan only when the market regime is BEAR.

NEUTRAL scans continue with a reduced seven-point RegimeScore contribution.

## Breakout Diagnostics

The Breakout Engine provides:

- Breakout55
- DistanceToHigh55

### Breakout55

```text
Latest close >= Highest high of the prior completed 55 sessions
```

### DistanceToHigh55

```text
(Current Price / Prior 55-session High - 1) * 100
```

The latest session high is excluded from the reference window.

Breakout diagnostics are exported to:

- Console output
- Candidate results
- Top20
- Excel reporting
- Diagnostic email reporting

Breakout diagnostics remain observational and do not participate in:

- Production filters
- Score calculation
- TradePlan logic
- Candidate ranking

## Observational Factors

The following factors remain observational:

- RSComposite
- Breakout55
- DistanceToHigh55

They must not affect production filters, score, TradePlan or ranking until historical and walk-forward validation demonstrates a statistically significant improvement.

## Completed-Session Volume Engine

The completed-session rules remain:

- Before 16:15 New York time, the current daily bar is treated as incomplete and the previous completed session is used.
- After 16:15 New York time, or when the latest bar is from an earlier date, the latest bar is used.
- Average volume uses the 20 sessions before the selected session.

## Score Engine

The Score Engine retains:

- TrendScore
- MomentumScore
- StrengthScore based on 63-session RelativeStrength
- VolumeScore
- RegimeScore
- MarketScore as a backwards-compatible alias
- ADXScore
- RiskPenalty

Multi-timeframe Relative Strength and the Backtest Metrics Foundation do not alter the production Score Engine.

## Diagnostics

Structured scanner outcomes:

- Passed
- Filtered
- Data Failure
- Indicator Failure
- Processing Error

The filter engine records:

- First rejection reason
- Every failed condition
- Market breadth

## Excel Workbook

Every successful scan produces the same five diagnostic worksheets:

1. `Top20`
2. `Scan Summary`
3. `First Rejections`
4. `All Failed Conditions`
5. `Market Breadth`

The Top20 results include multi-timeframe Relative Strength and breakout diagnostic fields.
